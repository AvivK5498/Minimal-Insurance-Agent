The GitHub Actions visibility issue is likely due to:\n1. GitHub needing time to detect the workflow after initial push\n2. Branch reference inconsistency (main vs master) potentially confusing users\n\nFix applied: Updated commented PR trigger branch reference from 'main' to 'master' to match repository default branch.\n\nChanges: \n- File: .github/workflows/agent-evals.yml\n- Lines 22-24: Changed branch reference in comment from [main] to [master]\n\nThis ensures consistency and may help GitHub Actions UI properly display the workflow.","created_at":"2026-01-15T16:04:21Z"}]}
