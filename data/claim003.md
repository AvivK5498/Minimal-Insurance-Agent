# **SECTION 1 — INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT**

### **1.1 Summary of Incident**
On **July 18, 2024**, at approximately 7:55 AM, the primary contact, Michael Torres, arrived at the studio and discovered that the rear loading entrance door was ajar. He initially assumed an employee might have arrived early, but upon entering he noticed the equipment staging area was in disarray. Several cases and shelving units had been forcibly opened.

After verifying with staff, he concluded that several pieces of high-value production equipment were missing. Security cameras on the interior were not operational due to an ongoing system upgrade, though the external camera partially captured suspicious activity in the early morning hours.

### **1.2 Missing Equipment (as reported by insured)**
- RED Komodo 6K Cinema Camera (serial #KMD002918)  
- Canon RF 24–70mm f/2.8 Lens  
- DJI Ronin RS3 Pro Gimbal  
- Apple MacBook Pro 16” (M2 Max)  
- Sennheiser EW-D Wireless Audio Kit  
- 2 TB Samsung Portable SSD containing client assets  

Estimated retail replacement value: **$26,300.00**  
Verification of purchase invoices provided and confirmed.

### **1.3 Point of Entry**
The intruder appears to have accessed the building through the **rear loading entrance**, which showed evidence of pry-bar usage along the strike plate. The door frame displayed moderate splintering.

A lock technician later confirmed that the latch had been compromised and the mechanism forced open.

# **SECTION 2 — SECURITY & POLICE REPORT SUMMARY**

### **2.1 Police Department Information**
- Responding Agency: Monterey Police Department  
- Reporting Officer: Sgt. Evelyn Carter (Badge #5192)  
- Report Number: MPD-24-441712  

### **2.2 Official Timeline**
- 08:07 AM — Officer dispatched  
- 08:14 AM — Officer on site  
- 08:54 AM — Scene cleared and report filed  

Sgt. Carter reviewed the external security camera footage and captured partial images of a hooded individual carrying a large duffel bag and a small hard-shell case. The figure moved quickly, and facial identification was not possible.

### **2.3 Officer Findings**
- No forced entry was detected on the *front* side of the building.  
- The rear entrance exhibited clear mechanical force.  
- No fingerprints were collected due to the textured metal surface and humidity.  
- An unidentified vehicle—likely a mid-2000s silver Nissan Frontier—was observed briefly idling near the loading zone around **5:51 AM** before departing.  

### **2.4 Disposition**
Case remains open; no suspects identified. Business was advised to upgrade access-point security and ensure camera functionality.

# **SECTION 5 — ADJUSTER NOTES (INTERNAL)**

### **5.1 Initial Observations**
- Insured responded promptly and cooperated fully during the investigation.  
- Documentation of purchase and serial numbers was provided and matches our internal records.  
- The business had an incomplete security upgrade in progress, which unfortunately left the interior cameras offline at the time of the break-in.

### **5.2 Concerns Raised**
While reviewing prior year claims, it is noted that Lighthouse Creative Media filed a minor claim two years earlier for a damaged lens. This does not directly affect coverage but is included for trend analysis.

External camera angle partially obstructed; the perpetrator’s approach was not visible until exit.

### **5.3 Subrogation Potential**
Low. The door’s existing lock was functional but not high-security grade. No manufacturer defect present. No third party liability identifiable.

### **5.4 Fraud Assessment**
No inconsistencies between the claimed losses and the company’s equipment inventory.  
Previous invoices and photos of equipment in use match the missing items.

No red flags of intentional misrepresentation detected.

### **5.5 Coverage Recommendation**
Approve claim under Equipment Floater and Business Property sections.  
ALE not applicable. Business interruption compensation to be evaluated under policy extension duration limits.
