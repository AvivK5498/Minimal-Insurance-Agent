# **SECTION 1 — INCIDENT REPORT**

### **1.1 Summary of Event**
According to the insured's online submission and subsequent phone interview, the incident occurred on **Highway 101 northbound**, approximately half a mile south of the Holly Street exit. Traffic conditions were described as moderately congested, with intermittent stop-and-go patterns due to late-evening construction.

The insured stated that her vehicle was traveling at approximately **45 mph** when she observed sudden brake lights from a black SUV ahead. She reportedly pressed her brakes hard but made contact with the rear bumper of the SUV. The SUV then swerved into the adjacent lane, striking a gray Honda Civic, while a fourth vehicle (a delivery van) collided into the insured's Camry from behind shortly after the initial contact.

Notably, one witness (later identified as **Sarah O’Connor-Smith**, who claimed to be the driver of the insured vehicle at the moment of impact despite registration records listing only Sarah Connor) reported that the SUV’s brake lights were “delayed or flickering,” suggesting a mechanical issue. The insured, however, claimed she was the one behind the wheel and insisted that her acquaintance simply provided an observational statement.

### **1.2 Environmental & Roadway Conditions**
- Lighting: Artificial highway illumination with mild glare reported.  
- Road Surface: Dry, slight dust from nearby construction zones.  
- Visibility: Fair, intermittent obstruction from construction barriers.  
- Weather: Clear skies, temperature approx. 62°F.  
- Construction: CalTrans temporary signage present; lane merging in progress.

### **1.3 Damage Summary**
- Front-end impact to insured’s Camry (bumper, hood deformation, grille damage)  
- Rear-end compression from secondary collision  
- Airbags deployed (front dual-stage)  
- Slight fuel leakage detected by responding units  
- Third vehicle (Honda Civic) sustained passenger-side intrusion  
- Utility van displayed moderate front-end crush profile

# **SECTION 2 — POLICE REPORT SUMMARY**

### **2.1 Officer Information**
- Reporting Officer: Sgt. Daniel H. Ruiz  
- Badge: 7713  
- Agency: California Highway Patrol (CHP – Redwood City Division)

### **2.2 Official Timeline**
- **Accident Time Stated:** **October 14, 2023, at 11:30 PM**  
- Units dispatched within 4 minutes; first responders arrived at approximately 11:36 PM.  
- Traffic was temporarily reduced to one lane. A hazmat contractor was later summoned due to the minor fuel seep identified beneath the insured vehicle.

### **2.3 Officer Observations**
The officer documented a four-vehicle chain collision preceded by sudden deceleration from the SUV. Brake wear was noted but not conclusively linked to malfunction. Sgt. Ruiz wrote that the insured vehicle “appeared to follow too closely for nighttime highway conditions.”

The delivery van’s driver admitted to being distracted by a GPS navigation rerouting notification moments before impact. All drivers tested negative for alcohol; the delivery van driver declined a voluntary roadside fatigue assessment.

### **2.4 Witness Accounts**
- **Witness 1 — Sarah O’Connor-Smith:** Reported being “in the passenger seat but looking directly over the dash” when she noticed the SUV decelerating abruptly. Her phrasing later suggested she may have been controlling the wheel temporarily, causing uncertainty for liability determination.
- **Witness 2 — Unrelated motorist:** Noted construction cones forced the SUV into a partial merge, possibly prompting sudden braking.

### **2.5 Citations Issued**
- Insured vehicle **not cited** pending insurance investigation.  
- Delivery van driver issued a warning for inattentive driving.  
- SUV driver cited for malfunctioning brake light (left-side flicker).

# **SECTION 5 — ADJUSTER NOTES (Internal Use Only)**

### **5.1 File Timeline**
- **10/15/23 — 08:10 AM:** Claim opened via online submission; insured lists herself as driver.  
- **10/15/23 — 09:40 AM:** Phone interview; insured mentions witness “O’Connor-Smith” was “helping adjust the GPS” at time of incident.  
- **10/16/23 — 11:20 AM:** Received police report; confirms crash at **11:30 PM** on 10/14/23.  
- **10/16/23 — 02:05 PM:** Received hospital report; admission time noted as **09:15 PM**, preceding crash. Internal discrepancy flagged.  
- **10/17/23 — 08:45 AM:** Collision center estimate uploaded.  
- **10/18/23 — 05:15 PM:** Preliminary liability review suggests potential shared fault among insured and SUV. Delivery van assigned secondary contributing responsibility.

### **5.2 Observations & Red Flags**
1. **Timeline inconsistency** between police-reported crash time and hospital admission time — recommend further verification with EMS logs.  
2. **Driver identity ambiguity:** Conflicting statements between Sarah Connor and **Sarah O’Connor-Smith** regarding who controlled the vehicle. DMV registry lists only Connor.  
3. **Commercial usage concern:** Social media posts (unverified but captured during open-source scan) show insured’s Camry reportedly used for freelance package pickups; aligns with potential trigger under **Exclusion Code EX-9982** relating to unauthorized commercial use of a personal vehicle.  
4. **Witness familiarity:** O’Connor-Smith listed as a “friend,” but behaved with decision-making authority at the scene and at the hospital.

### **5.3 Internal Assessment**
- Estimated total damages reasonably consistent with impact descriptions.  
- Medical complaints consistent with airbag deployment but timing inconsistency remains unexplained.  
- Recommend contacting hospital records department for confirmation of the intake timestamp; potential clerical error, though OCR intake logs appear digitally accurate.  
- Subrogation potential: moderate, depending on brake-light malfunction findings for SUV.

### **5.4 Next Steps**
- Verify EMS run sheets for accurate patient pickup time.  
- Request sworn statement from both Sarah Connor and Sarah O’Connor-Smith addressing discrepancies.  
- Confirm whether delivery van’s employer is liable under commercial fleet policy.  
- Evaluate eligibility of claim payment pending review of **EX-9982** exclusion parameters.
