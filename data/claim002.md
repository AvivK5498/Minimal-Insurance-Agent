# **SECTION 1 — INITIAL INCIDENT REPORT**

### **1.1 Summary Submitted by Insured**
On **December 3, 2024**, at approximately 6:40 AM, the insured awoke to a damp carpet outside the downstairs guest bedroom. Upon further inspection, he found water pooling near the baseboards, tracking inward from the shared wall between the laundry room and the guest bedroom. He reported a “steady dripping sound” behind the drywall.

After shutting off the home's main water supply, he removed a small section of drywall to identify the source. The exposed PEX line leading to the washing machine intake valve had ruptured longitudinally for several inches. The rupture caused ongoing water intrusion overnight, saturating the flooring and impacting structural components.

### **1.2 Extent of Observed Damage**
According to initial video evidence and uploaded photos:

- Saturated laminate flooring throughout approximately **380 sq ft** of the lower level.  
- Visible mold bloom beginning along the wall plate nearest the laundry room.  
- Water seepage through subfloor spaces into the crawl area.  
- Insulation within the shared wall fully saturated, requiring removal.  
- Minor bowing of an interior, non-load-bearing wall.  

### **1.3 Immediate Mitigation Efforts**
- Insured shut off water supply.  
- Towels and wet vac used temporarily before professional mitigation.  
- Mitigation contractor (EverDry Response Unit) arrived same day at 11:10 AM.  
- Dehumidifiers and air scrubbers installed.  
- Wall sections opened for airflow.

The insured acted promptly and within reasonable expectations to prevent secondary damage.

# **SECTION 2 — CONTRACTOR & INSPECTION NOTES**

### **2.1 Plumbing Assessment**
Plumbing contractor **NorthBay Pipeworks** confirmed that the failure occurred on a PEX line. The rupture pattern resembled sudden pressure expansion rather than slow degradation. They noted fluctuating municipal pressure events recorded earlier in the week could have contributed, but they stopped short of attributing sole causation.

The intake valve assembly was intact, and there were no observable signs of tampering or DIY modifications.

### **2.2 Structural Inspection**
Independent inspector **Laura Han, CST** observed:

- Moisture readings at baseboards exceeding 95% saturation.  
- Subfloor delamination in several regions.  
- Electrical outlet in the affected wall showed corrosion risk; recommended replacement.  
- Mold presence minimal but accelerating due to enclosed moisture pre-discovery.

She recommended partial flooring removal across the entire lower level to prevent uneven warping.

### **2.3 Additional Notes**
During her walkthrough, she observed that storage boxes stacked in the guest bedroom impeded airflow, raising concerns of hidden moisture pockets. She also emphasized checking for mold in the closet area once all belongings were removed.

# **SECTION 4 — ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES (ALE)**

### **4.1 Necessity of Temporary Lodging**
Due to floor removal, dehumidification equipment noise levels, and mold concerns, the home’s lower level became partially uninhabitable for a family with children. The insured relocated to a nearby short-term rental.

### **4.2 Itemized ALE Costs**

| Date Range | Description | Cost |
|------------|-------------|------|
| Dec 3–9, 2024 | Short-term rental (6 nights) | $1,146.00 |
| Dec 3–9, 2024 | Meal expenses (documented receipts) | $288.42 |
| Dec 3–9, 2024 | Laundry services due to inoperable machines | $34.50 |
| **Total ALE Claimed** | | **$1,468.92** |

# **SECTION 5 — ADJUSTER NOTES (INTERNAL)**

### **5.1 Summary of Investigation**
Initial inspection supports a sudden and accidental water discharge from an internal pressurized plumbing line, which is generally covered under HO-3 policies. No evidence of long-term leakage was identified.

However, questions arose regarding the exact onset time of the rupture. The insured asserted that no dampness or odor was present the night before, though digital thermostat logs show a steady humidity rise starting around **2:15 AM**, four hours before the insured claims discovery. This may reflect minor seepage that escalated rapidly once the pipe failed fully.

### **5.2 Potential Concerns**
- Storage boxes prevented early detection and contributed to increased wall damage.  
- Flooring type (low-cost laminate) is particularly vulnerable to water intrusion, increasing replacement costs.  
- Smart home data suggests slow leakage before discovery, though still likely within coverage guidelines.

### **5.3 Coverage Recommendation**
Based on current findings:

- **Mitigation and Restoration:** Recommended approved.  
- **ALE:** Reasonable and appropriately documented.  
- **Subrogation Opportunity:** Low; municipal pressure data inconclusive and PEX manufacturer not implicated.  
- **Fraud Concerns:** Minimal; timeline inconsistencies explainable as early minor seepage rather than negligence.

### **5.4 Next Steps**
- Confirm final mitigation invoice.  
- Await post-repair mold clearance documentation.  
- Issue initial advance payment to contractor upon policyholder approval.  
- Prepare closing file after settlement of remaining invoices.
